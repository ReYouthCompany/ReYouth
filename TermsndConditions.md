TERMS OF SERVICE & MEDICAL DISCLAIMER
THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT. Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") and Medical Disclaimer carefully before accessing or using the services provided by Re Youth. By enrolling in our programs, purchasing our plans, or using our consultancy services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
1. MEDICAL DISCLAIMER & LIABILITY WAIVER
(Pursuant to the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 & Consumer Protection Act, 2019)
1.1. Non-Medical Service Declaration : Re Youth is strictly a wellness, longevity tracking, and lifestyle consultancy service. We are not a licensed medical facility, hospital, or nursing home. Our personnel are wellness consultants, not licensed medical practitioners. Our services do not constitute "medical advice," "diagnosis," or "treatment" as defined under the National Medical Commission Act, 2019 or the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956
1.2. Consultation Mandate You acknowledge that the information provided by Re Youth (including diet plans, Systematic Health Plans, and aging analysis) is for educational purposes only. You agree to consult a licensed physician before starting any nutrition, detox, or fitness program, specifically if you have pre-existing conditions (including but not limited to diabetes, hypertension, cardiac issues, or pregnancy).
1.3. Holistic Health Approach Re Youth utilizes advanced high-frequency diagnostics to monitor your biological age and wellness metrics. We view our services as a proactive layer of health management. While we provide deep insights into your body’s functioning, specific medical diagnoses for acute diseases remain the domain of clinical medicine. We recommend using our insights in partnership with your healthcare provider for total health coverage.
1.4. Voluntary Participation Achieving significant health goals involves making necessary lifestyle and dietary adjustments. While our protocols are designed with safety as a priority, you acknowledge that any fitness or nutritional program carries a degree of personal exertion. By participating, you agree to exercise within your personal limits and assume responsibility for your well-being during the course of the program.

2. SERVICE SCOPE & RESULTS
(Pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 - Unfair Trade Practices)
2.1. Variability of Results You acknowledge that health outcomes (e.g., weight loss, biological age reduction, skin improvement) are dependent on individual genetics, metabolism, and strict adherence to the plan. Re Youth does not guarantee specific, quantifiable results (e.g., "lose 10kg in 1 month"). The absence of desired aesthetic or weight-loss results shall not constitute a "deficiency in service" under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.
2.2. "Quick Body Detox" Specifics The 1-week and 3-week detox plans are aesthetic and maintenance-focused programs designed for healthy individuals. They are not medical treatments for organ pathologies (e.g., liver cirrhosis, kidney failure).
2.3. Dietary & Supplement Safety If specific foods or supplements are recommended, you are solely responsible for checking ingredients for personal allergies. Re Youth shall not be liable for any allergic reactions, food intolerances, or adverse effects arising from third-party supplements.
3. DATA PRIVACY & THE "HEALTH DATA BANK"
(Pursuant to the Information Technology Act, 2000 - Section 43A & IT (SPDI) Rules, 2011)
3.1. Consent to Data Processing By using our services, you grant Re Youth explicit consent to collect, store, and analyze your Sensitive Personal Data or Information (SPDI), specifically biological markers, blood reports, and health history, for the purpose of generating health reports.
3.2. Security Commitment Your privacy is our priority. We have implemented strict digital safety protocols to ensure your biological data remains private and secure within our system. While we take every precaution to prevent unauthorized access, we ask users to acknowledge the inherent nature of digital storage. We pledge to handle your data with the utmost care and in full compliance with data privacy laws.
3.3. User-Controlled Data Sharing You retain full ownership of your health data. We do not monetize or trade your personal information. Sharing is limited strictly to operational needs (e.g., coordinating with labs for your blood work). We will never release your records to outside agencies, insurance companies, or other third parties without your explicit, written consent.
4. PAYMENTS, REFUNDS & CANCELLATION
(Pursuant to the Indian Contract Act, 1872)
4.1. No-Refund Policy Due to the personalized nature of our diet plans, reports, and consultancy analysis, all fees paid are non-refundable once the service/plan has been generated, delivered, or the consultation has commenced.
4.2. Payment Disputes & Fraud Any attempt to initiate a fraudulent chargeback, payment reversal, or dispute with a bank after receiving services will be considered a breach of this contract. Re Youth reserves the right to terminate your account immediately and pursue legal action to recover the disputed amount along with legal fees and administrative costs.
4.3. Subscription Management Your subscription helps maintain uninterrupted access to your health data. To ensure a seamless experience, plans automatically renew at the end of each cycle. If you wish to pause or cancel, simply provide a notice at least 7 days prior to your next billing date. This allows us strictly enough time to process the request and prevent any unintended charges for the upcoming cycle.

5. INDEMNIFICATION
 You agree to defend, indemnify, and protect Re Youth and its affiliates from any liabilities, damages, or costs (including legal fees) arising out of your use of our services. This indemnification specifically applies to instances where you fail to adhere to the provided dietary or fitness guidelines, or where you engage in the service despite medical contraindications.
6. LEGAL GOVERNANCE 
6.1. Governing Law These Terms and any separate agreements whereby we provide you services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India.
6.2. Exclusive Venue To ensure efficient resolution of legal matters, both parties explicitly agree that any legal proceedings regarding these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in Dhanbad, Jharkhand.
TERMINATION OF SERVICE 
 Re Youth reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account immediately, without prior notice or refund, if: (a) You violate these Terms; (b) You engage in abusive, threatening, or harassing behavior towards our staff or founders; (c) We detect fraudulent activity or unauthorized sharing of your account credentials.
